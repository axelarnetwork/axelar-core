## axelard keys

Manage your application's keys

### Synopsis

Keyring management commands. These keys may be in any format supported by the
Tendermint crypto library and can be used by light-clients, full nodes, or any other application
that needs to sign with a private key.

The keyring supports the following backends:

```
os          Uses the operating system's default credentials store.
file        Uses encrypted file-based keystore within the app's configuration directory.
            This keyring will request a password each time it is accessed, which may occur
            multiple times in a single command resulting in repeated password prompts.
kwallet     Uses KDE Wallet Manager as a credentials management application.
pass        Uses the pass command line utility to store and retrieve keys.
test        Stores keys insecurely to disk. It does not prompt for a password to be unlocked
            and it should be use only for testing purposes.
```

kwallet and pass backends depend on external tools. Refer to their respective documentation for more
information:
KWallet     https://github.com/KDE/kwallet
pass        https://www.passwordstore.org/

The pass backend requires GnuPG: https://gnupg.org/

### Options

```
  -h, --help                     help for keys
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|test) (default "test")
      --keyring-dir string       The client Keyring directory; if omitted, the default 'home' directory will be used
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --home string         directory for config and data (default "$HOME/.axelar")
      --log_format string   The logging format (json|plain) (default "plain")
      --log_level string    The logging level (trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal|panic) (default "info")

      --trace               print out full stack trace on errors
```
