## axelarcli tx sign

Sign transactions generated offline

### Synopsis

Sign transactions created with the --generate-only flag.
It will read a transaction from \[file\], sign it, and print its JSON encoding.

If the flag --signature-only flag is set, it will output a JSON representation
of the generated signature only.

If the flag --validate-signatures is set, then the command would check whether all required
signers have signed the transactions, whether the signatures were collected in the right
order, and if the signature is valid over the given transaction. If the --offline
flag is also set, signature validation over the transaction will be not be
performed as that will require RPC communication with a full node.

The --offline flag makes sure that the client will not reach out to full node.
As a result, the account and sequence number queries will not be performed and
it is required to set such parameters manually. Note, invalid values will cause
the transaction to fail.

The --multisig=\<multisig_key> flag generates a signature on behalf of a multisig account
key. It implies --signature-only. Full multisig signed transactions may eventually
be generated via the 'multisign' command.

axelarcli tx sign [file] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --account-number uint      The account number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --append                   Append the signature to the existing ones. If disabled, old signatures would be overwritten. Ignored if --multisig is on (default true)
  -b, --broadcast-mode string    Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async|block) (default "sync")
      --dry-run                  ignore the --gas flag and perform a simulation of a transaction, but don't broadcast it
      --fees string              Fees to pay along with transaction; eg: 10uatom
      --from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
      --gas string               gas limit to set per-transaction; set to "auto" to calculate required gas automatically (default 200000) (default "200000")
      --gas-adjustment float     adjustment factor to be multiplied against the estimate returned by the tx simulation; if the gas limit is set manually this flag is ignored  (default 1)
      --gas-prices string        Gas prices to determine the transaction fee (e.g. 10uatom)
      --generate-only            Build an unsigned transaction and write it to STDOUT (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible and the node operates offline)
  -h, --help                     help for sign
      --indent                   Add indent to JSON response
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|test) (default "os")
      --ledger                   Use a connected Ledger device
      --memo string              Memo to send along with transaction
      --multisig string          Address of the multisig account on behalf of which the transaction shall be signed
      --node string              <host>:<port> to tendermint rpc interface for this chain (default "tcp://localhost:26657")
      --offline                  Offline mode; Do not query a full node. --account and --sequence options would be required if offline is set
      --output-document string   The document will be written to the given file instead of STDOUT
  -s, --sequence uint            The sequence number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --signature-only           Print only the generated signature, then exit
      --trust-node               Trust connected full node (don't verify proofs for responses) (default true)
      --validate-signatures      Print the addresses that must sign the transaction, those who have already signed it, and make sure that signatures are in the correct order
  -y, --yes                      Skip tx broadcasting prompt confirmation
```
