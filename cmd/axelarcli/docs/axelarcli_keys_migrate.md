## axelarcli keys migrate

Migrate keys from the legacy (db-based) Keybase

### Synopsis

Migrate key information from the legacy (db-based) Keybase to the new keyring-based Keybase. For each key material
entry, the command will prompt if the key should be skipped or not. If the key is not to be skipped, the passphrase must
be entered. The key will only be migrated if the passphrase is correct. Otherwise, the command will exit and migration
must be repeated.

It is recommended to run in 'dry-run' mode first to verify all key migration material.

```
axelarcli keys migrate [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run   Run migration without actually persisting any changes to the new Keybase
  -h, --help      help for migrate
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --chain-id string          Network ID of tendermint node
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|test) (default "os")
```
